          <h3 class="card-title">The Beginner’s Guide to Building a Daily Hair Care Routine</h3>
          <p class="card-text">Here’s something every girl should know: your hair deserves just as much TLC as your skin does. The “skin-ification” of hair is a thing right now – as it should be! The logic here is that the same ingredients that make your skin glow can also do wonders for your hair.

            Considering that your scalp and hair endure the same beating your skin suffers from the sun and pollution, it’s only right that you give your tresses the same amount of love. It’s time to start pampering your hair with a multi-step daily routine, just as you would with your skin.
            
            Step up your hair care game with this basic daily routine to keep the frizz and damage at bay, and have only good hair days ahead.</p>
        <p><h3> Daily Hair Routine</h3></p>
        <p><h4> Shampoo/Dry Shampoo</h4></p>
        <p>It’s not healthy to wash your hair every day, especially if you have thick or curly hair. Overwashing strips your hair and scalp of their natural oils and proteins, which causes dryness. Limit your washes to two to three times a week, depending on how oily your hair gets.

            On days when you do wash your hair, use a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates are known to cause frizz, making your tresses difficult to manage. Look for shampoos formulated for your hair type. If you have dry hair, for example, search for the best hydrating shampoo that’s readily available to you.
            
            On days when you skip the shower, dry shampoo is your best friend. This product helps keep the oiliness at bay. Spritz just enough product on your roots to soak up the oil. Avoid overusing dry shampoo, especially if it contains alcohol because it can dry out your hair.</p>
        <p><h4> Conditioner</h4></p>
        <p>Conditioner is a must-have, regardless of your hair type. It locks in moisture in your tresses, smoothing down frizz and flyaway strands. Don’t apply too much, though. Use just enough to coat the length of the strands until the tips. Unless your hair is extremely dry from styling and bleaching, don’t apply conditioner to your roots because it can cause your scalp to oil up faster.

            Leave the conditioner for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly.</p>
        <p><h4> Leave In Conditioner</h4></p>
        <p>If you have dry hair or if you like to style and dye your hair often, we recommend using a leave-in conditioner on days when you wash your hair. This product will not only moisturize your tresses, but it will also make your hair look shinier and, thus, healthier.

            Leave-in conditioner is best applied on damp hair and before using heat-styling tools. Keep the product away from your roots, though. Apply it only on the strands to keep your scalp clean and oil-free.
            
            Moisture is a must for every hair type. Keep your tresses healthy by avoiding habits that dry out your scalp and incorporating ultra-hydrating products in your daily hair routine.</p>
        <p><h4> Drying</h4></p>
        <p>Once you’ve finished applying all your products, it’s time to dry your hair. Keep in mind that friction can damage your tresses, so you want to avoid drying your hair using cotton towels.

            According to long-time beauty gurus, the best way to dry your hair is to air-dry 70 to 80 percent of the way then blow-drying until completely dry.
            
            Use an ionic hair dryer instead of a regular one. This wet-to-dry hair styler is perfect for damage-prone tresses. It evaporates water droplets faster, so your hair dries much quicker. Your hair is exposed to less heat, reducing the likelihood for damage.
            
            This daily routine should hydrate and nourish your hair, preventing damage and frizz and making it look healthier. For an added boost, you can add a step or two to your weekly routine to give your hair some extra TLC.</p>
        <p><h4> Styling</h4></p>
        <p>before using your styling tools, coat your hair strands with some heat protectant. Heat protectants act as a protective barrier between your hair and the hot styling tool. This prevents the strands from drying out, getting fried, and becoming dull.

            The truth is that heat styling takes a toll on your tresses, so it’s important to keep your hair protected from heat damage. The good news? It’s easy to prevent this type of damage. As long as you use a good heat protectant and high-quality tools, you can straighten or curl your hair without damage.</p>
       
        <p><h3> Weekly Hair Routine</h3></p>
        <p><h4> Deep Conditioner</h4></p>
        <p>Deep conditioners like hair masks and hair treatments are like conditioners on steroids. They’re loaded with proteins and nutrients that give you fresh-from-the-salon hair. Using a deep conditioner once a week will make your tresses ultra-soft. It also makes your hair super shiny, bouncy, and healthy-looking.

            Look for deep conditioning hair treatments that’s specially formulated for your hair type so it’s sure to get the nourishment it needs.</p>
        <p><h4> Oil Massage</h4></p>
        <p>Use hair oils once a week for maximum hydration. Oils are packed with vitamins and fatty acids that breathe new life into your hair, nourishing each strand from root to tip.

            Gently massage the oil onto your scalp and roots for a few minutes. Rinse thoroughly to prevent your scalp from oiling up.
            
            Just like with your skincare routine, you have to be diligent with your hair care regimen. Supplement your hair care routine with healthy habits, like getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet. This way, your hair is nourished from the inside out, achieving maximum shine and hydration.</p>
