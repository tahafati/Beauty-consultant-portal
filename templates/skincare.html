          <h3 class="card-title">10 step korean skincare routine</h3>
          <p class="card-text">The 10-Step is more than a routine—it's a lifestyle that has become a global phenomenon, grounded in Korea's cultural obsession with healthy skin and backed by decades of scientific advancement. It's not about having more products than you can count, but rather about having the right products that do the right things, and using them in the right order.
        </p>
        <p><h4> STEP  1 Oil-based cleanser</h4></p>
        <p>Oil and water repel each other, which means that a water-based cleanser won’t effectively remove all the oil-based impurities on your skin.

            SPF, makeup, and your body’s natural sebum are most effectively removed with an oil-based cleanser. This doesn’t strip the natural healthy oils from your face. </p>
        <p><h4> STEP  2 Water-based cleanser</h4></p>
        <p>This is the type of cleanser most people likely think of when they hear the word “cleanser.” This is usually a foaming liquid (or bar) that removes the remaining impurities left behind by the oil cleanser, such as sweat and dirt.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  3 Exfoliant</h4></p>
        <p>Exfoliants are things like scrubs, peels, and pads. These products help remove dead skin cells and buildup. Start slow and do it sparingly (once or twice per week max).</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  4 Toner</h4></p>
        <p>Once you get to this step, your skin’s pH might be out of whack and need to be returned to its acidic state.

            Toners help restore the balance and bring moisture back to the skin.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  5 Essence</h4></p>
        <p>Unique to Korean skin care regimens, essences are formulated with fermented ingredients and are meant to hydrate and protect skin. Think of an essence as somewhere between a toner and a serum.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  6 Treatment</h4></p>
        <p>In Korean skin care, a treatment is anything that’s focused on aiding a specific problem — usually referred to as a serum. They contain highly concentrated ingredients meant to target specific issues, such as wrinkles or acne.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  7 Sheet Mask</h4></p>
        <p>Sheet masks are sheets of serum-soaked paper that you lay on your face for about 20 minutes. Like exfoliants, sheet masks aren’t something that needs to be or should be done every day.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  8 Eye Cream</h4></p>
        <p>Eye gels, creams, or oils are made to target the thin, sensitive skin around the eyes while helping with darkness, puffiness, and fine lines.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  9 Moisturizer</h4></p>
        <p>It acts as a sealant to ensure everything soaks into your skin.</p>
        <p><h4> STEP  10 SPF</h4></p>
        <p>Lately, people seem to be acknowledging the effects of sun damage more and more. More products, like foundation and moisturizer, are being sold with built-in SPF.

            Even if you will wear another product with SPF, it’s still very important to include this step.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Know your skin better :)</h3>
          <p><strong> What are the four different skin types?</strong></p>
          <p class="card-text">There are four basic types of healthy skin: normal, dry, oily and combination skin. Your skin types depend on how much water is in your skin (as this affects elasticity and comfort), how oily it is and how sensitive it is. Each skin type has its own characteristics and required treatments.

            If you need help with identifying your skin type the skin test may be a useful tool. If you need further advice on how best to care for it, speak to a dermatologist or pharmacist.</p>
          <p><strong> Dry skin</strong></p>
          <p>Dry’ is used to describe a skin type that produces less sebum than normal skin. As a result of the lack of sebum, dry skin lacks the lipids that it needs to retain moisture and build a protective shield against external influences.People with dry skin may have a rough complexion, red patches, more visible lines and almost invisible pores. Dry skin is less elastic</p>
          <p><strong>Normal Skin</strong></p>
          <p>‘Normal’ is a term widely used to refer to well-balanced skin. The scientific term for healthy skin is eudermic.

            Characteristics of normal skin include a regular texture, no or few imperfections and a soft appearance. Normal skin does not require special care.</p>
         
            <p><strong> Oily Skin</strong></p>
          <p>‘Oily’ is used to describe a skin type with heightened sebum production. An over production is known as seborrhea.

            This has a bright and porous appearance. Oily skin can vary in severity depending on the time of year. Changes can be caused by stress, heat, puberty or other hormonal changes.</p>
          <p><strong> Combination Skin</strong></p>
          <p>Combination skin is, as the name suggests, skin that consists of a mix of skin types.

            Skin can be dry or normal in some areas, but oily in others, like the T-zone (nose, forehead and chin). This is a common skin type and may require different treatment in different areas.
